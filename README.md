## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project employs a PyTorch-based orthogonal NeRF model, and utilizes the function‚Äôs density output as a data filter to gather 3D spatial data. This is achieved by training the network on a dataset of scene view images, and then using the trained network to predict the 3D point cloud for the given input scene.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 


### Python 3
For this project, you will need [Python 3.8](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or greater. To install the Python libraries necessary, run the installs via `pip` command.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### NeRF Model

This project relies on a trained NeRF model. For more information on training a NeRF model for a scene, see the documentation.

## üöÄ Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To generate a colored depth map of the scene, run the following command.

```bash
python3 mapping.py
```
